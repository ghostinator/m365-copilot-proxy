# m365-copilot-proxy

Use Microsoft 365 Copilot as an LLM backend for OpenAI-compatible coding agents like [pi](https://pi.dev/) and [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/). Wraps M365 Copilot's WebSocket/SignalR API in an OpenAI-compatible interface with tool calling support.

> **Want the gory protocol details?** See [docs/m365-copilot-api.md](docs/m365-copilot-api.md) — a full write-up of M365 Copilot's undocumented WebSocket API: auth, SignalR frames, tones/models, throttling, the "Disengaged" filter, and the Copilot Studio agent trick that makes tool calling work.

## How it works

M365 Copilot uses a SignalR WebSocket protocol, not the OpenAI API. This project translates between the two:

1. **Standalone proxy** — HTTP server with `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models` endpoints. Works with any OpenAI-compatible client (pi, OpenClaw, etc.).
2. **OpenClaw plugin** — Config generator + setup CLI for OpenClaw's provider system.

### Tool calling

M365 Copilot doesn't support OpenAI-style `tool_calls` natively. Instead, tools are
emulated via a **Markdown-fence format** (the JSON `{"tool":...}` format was removed —
it scored 0/5 on real agentic tasks; see [hypotheses §9](docs/hypotheses.md)):

- Tool definitions are injected into the prompt as fenced templates inside a `<tools>` block
- The model emits a fenced tool call — a code block whose info-string is the tool name
  (scalar args as `key: value` header lines, one free-form body arg as the fence body,
  `old`/`new` edits as aider-style `SEARCH/REPLACE` diffs)
- The proxy/handler parses that and converts it to OpenAI `tool_calls` format
- **Shell-routing (the key lever):** M365's chat-tuned model won't "act as an agent" on
  demand but *will* reflexively write a ```` ```bash ```` block. When the toolset includes a
  shell tool (`bash`/`shell`/`run`/`run_command`/… — any name), the proxy injects "do the
  whole step by writing one ```` ```bash ```` block" framing and routes that block to the
  shell tool. This exploits the one agentic behavior Microsoft's system prompt permits, and
  is what turns 0/5 into real multi-turn loops (verified 9-tool-call bug fix).
- **Reliability comes from the Copilot Studio agent (below) + the fenced/shell framing** —
  without the agent, M365 ignores tool instructions and answers in prose

### Agent mode

On first use, the system creates a **Copilot Studio agent** with tool-calling instructions baked into its server-side system prompt. This is done via the PowerPlatform API:

1. Discovers the environment URL via the BAP API (`api.bap.microsoft.com`)
2. Creates a bot with instructions in the Copilot Studio `minimalBots` API
3. Publishes the bot to get a `TitleId`
4. Uses the agent ID (`T_{titleId}.{botId}.gpt.default`) in WebSocket chat requests
5. Caches the agent ID in `~/.config/opencode-m365/agent-id.json`

### Conversation reuse

Each agent session reuses the same M365 conversation (same `sessionId` + `conversationId`). The WebSocket reconnects per turn but M365 maintains server-side context. This saves quota — the 600 message limit applies per-conversation.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+
- pnpm 10+
- An M365 account with Copilot access
- A way to sign in, either:
  - **TOTP-based MFA with the base32 secret in hand** — the automated login types the
    6-digit code itself, so it needs the seed, not an app on your phone. See
    [Getting the TOTP secret](#getting-the-totp-secret). This is the headless-friendly
    option; prefer it if your tenant allows it.
  - **or a display and 30 seconds** — set `M365_ENABLE_INTERACTIVE_APPROVAL=1` and sign
    in by hand once. Required if your tenant has [no TOTP option](#if-your-tenant-has-no-totp-option)
    (push-only MFA, FIDO2, Okta/Ping/Duo).

### 1. Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cramt/m365-copilot-proxy
cd m365-copilot-proxy
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### 2. Configure credentials

Create `~/.config/opencode-m365/secrets.json`:

```json
{
  "email": "you@company.com",
  "password": "your-password",
  "mfaSecret": "YOUR_TOTP_BASE32_SECRET"
}
```

`mfaSecret` is the **base32 seed** your authenticator app derives its 6-digit codes
from — not a code itself. It looks like `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`: 16–32 characters, `A`–`Z`
and `2`–`7` only, no spaces.

#### Getting the TOTP secret

**Already using a password manager for TOTP? Just read it back out.** 1Password,
Bitwarden, KeePassXC, Aegis, Ente Auth and friends all keep the seed and will show it
on demand — open the item's one-time-password field and reveal it. You'll get either a
bare base32 string or an `otpauth://totp/...?secret=JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP&...` URI; in the
second case the `secret=` parameter is the bit you want. No re-enrollment needed.

**If the seed is trapped in Microsoft Authenticator, enroll a second method.** That app
deliberately never exposes it, and Microsoft's security-info page won't re-display the
key after enrollment either — between them that's the only case where the seed is
genuinely unrecoverable. Enroll a fresh entry and copy it on the way past:

1. Go to <https://aka.ms/mfasetup> (**My Account → Security info**).
2. **Add sign-in method → Authenticator app**.
3. Click **"I want to use a different authenticator app"**. This step is the one that
   matters — the default path assumes Microsoft Authenticator and registers a
   push-only method with no seed you can extract.
4. At the QR-code screen, click **"Can't scan image?"**. It reveals a **Secret key** —
   that's your base32 string.
5. Generate a code from it to finish enrollment — `oathtool --totp -b <secret>`, or
   paste the seed into your password manager — and enter that code.

Store it somewhere that will give it back (see above) so this is a one-time chore. The
new entry sits alongside your existing sign-in methods; you don't have to remove
Microsoft Authenticator.

#### If your tenant has no TOTP option

Plenty of tenants can't do the above, and then there is no seed to extract:

- the authenticator-app / software-OATH method is disabled by tenant policy;
- MFA is push / number-matching only, FIDO2, Windows Hello, or certificate-based;
- sign-in is federated to a third-party IdP (Okta, Ping, Duo) that owns the MFA step.

The stored-credentials flow above cannot work in those cases — the automated login has
no code to type, and no amount of configuration fixes that.

**Use interactive approval instead.** Skip `secrets.json` entirely and set:

```sh
export M365_ENABLE_INTERACTIVE_APPROVAL=1
m365-proxy 4141
```

A real browser window opens; you complete SSO/MFA by hand exactly as you would in
Outlook — push, FIDO2, Okta, whatever your tenant enforces. The proxy captures the
resulting OAuth code and from then on refreshes tokens silently from the MSAL cache,
so the window is a **one-time cost**, not a per-run prompt. It also kicks in when
stored credentials exist but stop working (policy change, MFA method swap).

Contributed by [@EatonWu](https://github.com/EatonWu). Two honest caveats:

- It is **opt-in on purpose.** Without the flag a headless host (systemd, CI, a second
  PC) fails loudly instead of hanging on a window nobody can see. Set
  `M365_NO_INTERACTIVE=1` to veto it outright.
- The redirect capture and token exchange are the same ones the automated path uses in
  production, but **nobody has yet run this end to end against a federated Okta/Ping/Duo
  tenant.** If that's you, please report in
  [#4](https://github.com/cramt/m365-copilot-proxy/issues/4) — working or not.

#### First run

On first run, the system does an automated browser login (via Playwright/Chromium) to get OAuth tokens. After that, tokens refresh silently from the MSAL cache.

### 3. Use with pi (or any OpenAI-compatible agent)

Start the proxy:

```sh
m365-proxy 4143        # or: pnpm run proxy 4143
```

Point [pi](https://pi.dev/) at it via `~/.pi/agent/models.json`:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "m365": {
      "baseUrl": "http://localhost:4143/v1",
      "api": "openai-completions",
      "apiKey": "not-needed",
      "compat": {
        "supportsDeveloperRole": false,
        "supportsReasoningEffort": false,
        "supportsUsageInStreaming": false
      },
      "models": [
        { "id": "gpt-5.5-think-deeper", "name": "M365 Copilot (GPT-5.5, recommended)" },
        { "id": "m365-copilot", "name": "M365 Copilot (Auto)" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> `apiKey` is a placeholder. The proxy binds to localhost and validates no
> credential — the field exists only because the OpenAI client schema requires it.

Then run pi (use `gpt-5.5-think-deeper` — the reliable tool-calling model — and keep the
toolset lean; M365 "disengages" on very large tool payloads, see
[docs/m365-copilot-api.md](docs/m365-copilot-api.md#the-disengaged-filter)):

```sh
pi --models "gpt-5.5-think-deeper" -p --tools read,list,edit,write "your task"
```

This is verified working end-to-end, including multi-tool calls and real file edits.

### 4. Use with OpenClaw

```sh
# Configure and start in one command
m365-openclaw-setup --start

# Or configure only, then start separately
m365-openclaw-setup
m365-proxy 4141
```

The proxy uses session reuse and delta messages — follow-up turns only send new messages, saving M365 quota. New conversations are detected automatically when the message array shrinks or the first user message changes.

### 5. Use as standalone proxy

```sh
npx m365-proxy 4141
# or
pnpm run dev
```

Then point any OpenAI-compatible client at `http://localhost:4141/v1`.

#### Temporary chats

Proxy conversations use M365 **temporary-chat mode by default**
(`disableMemory=1` on the authenticated Chathub URL), so they are not added to
the Copilot history sidebar while multi-turn context still works for the live
conversation. Set `M365_SAVE_HISTORY=1` before starting the proxy only if you
deliberately want proxy chats saved in Copilot history.

### 6. Run on NixOS (systemd service)

The proxy is a [Nitro](https://nitro.build/) service. The flake exposes a package
(built from the workspace via [pnpm2nix](https://github.com/cramt/pnpm2nix)) and a NixOS
module:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs.m365.url = "github:cramt/m365-copilot-proxy";

  outputs = { nixpkgs, m365, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.myhost = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        m365.nixosModules.default
        {
          services.m365-copilot-proxy = {
            enable = true;
            # JSON with { email, password, mfaSecret } — kept out of the Nix store,
            # delivered via systemd LoadCredential. Manage with sops-nix/agenix.
            secretsFile = "/run/secrets/m365-copilot.json";
            # port = 4141;          # default
            # host = "127.0.0.1";   # default — do not expose; unauthenticated, paid account
            # openFirewall = false;
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

The service runs as a hardened `DynamicUser` unit. Auth state (`msal-cache.json`,
`agent-id.json`) persists in `/var/lib/m365-copilot-proxy`; a fresh deploy self-bootstraps
via headless login using `secretsFile` + the bundled Chromium. To run the package directly
without NixOS: `nix run github:cramt/m365-copilot-proxy -- 4141`.

### 7. Run natively on Windows

See [docs/windows-proxy.md](docs/windows-proxy.md) for PowerShell-native
setup/start/stop/validate scripts under `scripts\windows\` (no WSL/bash
required), loopback verification, and Windows-specific troubleshooting.

## Available models

| Model ID | M365 Tone | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `gpt-6-think-deeper` | Gpt_6_Reasoning | GPT-6 reasoning. **Needs a paid/premium Copilot seat** (see below); 30/30 on the bench (agent-less, `relay` framing) |
| `gpt-6-sol` | Gpt_6_Sol_Reasoning | GPT-6 Sol ("GPT 6.0 Sol" in the web UI). **Works on every account**, no paid seat needed; uses the tool agent only on a premium account (see below). With the `relay` framing: 30/30 on the bench with the agent, 60/60 without, 21/21 driving real pi |
| `gpt-5.6-think-deeper` | Gpt_5_6_Reasoning | GPT-5.6 reasoning — 27/30 on the bench, tied with `gpt-5.5-think-deeper` |
| `gpt-5.6` / `gpt-5.6-quick` | Gpt_5_6_Chat | GPT-5.6 fast ("GPT 5.6 Quick response" in the web UI). **Weak at tool calling** — 7/30 on the bench (see below) |
| `gpt-5.5-think-deeper` | Gpt_5_5_Reasoning | **Recommended default for agents/tool-calling** — 26/30 on the bench |
| `gpt-5.5` / `gpt-5.5-quick` | Gpt_5_5_Chat | GPT-5.5 fast — 16/30 on the bench, the strongest benchmarked chat tone |
| `m365-copilot` / `auto` | magic | Auto-routing — high-variance at tool-calling (confabulates; see below) |
| `quick` | Gpt_5_5_Chat | Alias of `gpt-5.5` (its old `Gpt_Quick` tone was retired — see below) |
| `think-deeper` | Gpt_5_5_Reasoning | Alias of `gpt-5.5-think-deeper` (its old `Gpt_Reasoning` tone was retired) |
| `claude` / `claude-sonnet` / `claude-sonnet-4.6` | Claude_Sonnet | Real Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.6 (agent-less path) — 78/90 on the bench with the `relay` framing (47/76 with `baseline`). `claude-sonnet-4.5` is kept as an alias |
| `claude-sonnet-5` | Claude_Sonnet (paid scenario) | Claude Sonnet 5. **Needs a paid/premium Copilot seat** — same tone as above, the scenario picks the model. 27/30 on the bench with the `relay` framing (6/40 with `baseline`; see below) |
| `claude-sonnet-think-deeper` | Claude_Sonnet_Reasoning | Claude reasoning |
| `claude-opus` / `claude-opus-5` | Claude_Opus | Real Claude Opus 5. **Needs a paid/premium Copilot seat** and has a small separate quota (see below) |
| `gpt-5.4` / `gpt-5.4-quick` | Gpt_5_4_* | GPT-5.4 |
| `gpt-5.3` / `gpt-5.3-think-deeper` | Gpt_5_3_* | GPT-5.3 |
| `gpt-5.2` / `gpt-5.2-think-deeper` | Gpt_5_2_* | GPT-5.2 |

Bench scores are 10 tasks × 3 reps with the confab-retry **off** (`M365_NO_CONFAB_RETRY=1`), so
every first-try give-up counts, including ones the proxy's retry would normally recover
([hypotheses §19](docs/hypotheses.md)). GPT-6's 24/30 was measured with the retry on, so it
isn't directly comparable.

> **Microsoft retired the `*_Quick` tones; `*_Chat` tones replaced them.** Every `quick` /
> `*-quick` model ID still works and resolves to the replacement `*_Chat` tone (e.g.
> `gpt-5.3-quick` → `Gpt_5_3_Chat`), so existing configs need no change.

> ✅ **For tool calling, use `gpt-5.5-think-deeper` (the default when no model is sent).**
> The current agent + fenced/shell-routing path makes this reasoning tone robust:
> 26/30 on the bench, tied with `gpt-5.6-think-deeper` and well ahead of every benchmarked
> chat tone (docs/hypotheses.md §19), and 100% compliance and solve across prompt/toolset
> sizes in the tool-call harness (§12.10/§12.11). The **default `m365-copilot` (magic) tone is *not* reliable** for
> tools — it confabulates ("I no longer have access to the filesystem tools") and solves
> ~0% of real tasks (§12.11); a proxy request with no `model` field already defaults to
> `gpt-5.5-think-deeper` for this reason.
>
> ⚠️ The **older** reasoning tones (`gpt-5.2`/`gpt-5.3`/`gpt-5.4` `*-think-deeper`, bare
> `gpt-5.4`) route through M365's `DeepLeo` pipeline, which meta-analyzes the
> injected prompt and can disengage from tools. Prefer `gpt-5.5-think-deeper`.
> See [docs/m365-copilot-api.md](docs/m365-copilot-api.md) §5/§10.

### GPT-5.6 chat (`gpt-5.6` / `gpt-5.6-quick`) — newer, and worse at agentic work

The web client calls this one **"GPT 5.6 Quick response"**, which is the shape to expect:
it is the chat sibling of `gpt-5.6-think-deeper`, not a reasoning tone, and it self-identifies
as "the GPT-5 chat model" — exactly as `Gpt_5_5_Chat` does. Neither tone will tell you which
generation is actually answering, so don't pick between them on self-report.

**Pick it for chat, not for tools.** A higher version number is not an upgrade here: on the
bench it solves **7/30**, against **16/30** for `gpt-5.5`. Its low message count (39 vs 69)
is not efficiency: 22 of its 23 failures gave up before making a single tool call. See
[hypotheses §19](docs/hypotheses.md).

**No entitlement needed.** It reaches a model on the default `OfficeWebIncludedCopilot`
scenario, so the proxy sends nothing special for it. This is newly true: until recently the
tone deflected with the canned `BotConnection` apology on the included scenario while serving
normally under `OfficeWebPaidCopilot` — it was entitlement-gated like Opus, which
[hypotheses §12.15](docs/hypotheses.md) had misfiled as a permanently dead route.
See [§18](docs/hypotheses.md) for the correction.

### GPT-6 (`gpt-6-think-deeper`) — entitlement, but no separate quota

**It needs the paid scenario, exactly like Opus.** On the default
`OfficeWebIncludedCopilot` the `Gpt_6_Reasoning` tone is accepted and then deflects with the
canned apology; under `OfficeWebPaidCopilot` it serves normally. The proxy sends the paid
scenario automatically whenever the resolved tone is `Gpt_6_Reasoning`, so nothing has to be
configured — but this is an **entitlement, not a bypass**, and a seat without paid/premium
access will see the apology no matter which scenario is requested.

**It is not metered separately, and that is the part worth stating.** The paid scenario is an
entitlement gate; it does not imply a budget. GPT-6 has no priority-access allowance and is
throttled by the same per-conversation cap and thread-rate governor as every other model, so
none of the Opus advice about rationing turns applies.

**Tool calls go without the tool agent, and with the `relay` framing.** With the Copilot Studio
tool agent attached, `Gpt_6_Reasoning` doesn't serve at all (a canned apology, on every account),
so the proxy sends GPT-6 tool requests agent-less, as it does Claude's (#41). Agent-less, under the
`baseline` framing GPT-6 worked in M365's own code interpreter instead of calling your tools:
0/30 on the bench. Under `relay` it scored **30/30** (confab-retry off, 2026-10-01), and 5/5 driving real pi. Both are the
defaults now; `M365_FORCE_AGENT=1` and `M365_FRAMING_VARIANT` still override them.
`gpt-5.5-think-deeper` remains the recommended default and the no-model fallback, because it needs
no entitlement: making GPT-6 the default would hand most seats a model they can't reach.

### GPT-6 Sol (`gpt-6-sol`) — no entitlement, the agent only on premium

The web client calls it **"GPT 6.0 Sol"**; the tone is `Gpt_6_Sol_Reasoning` and it identifies
itself as the GPT-6 reasoning model. Unlike `gpt-6-think-deeper` it is **not** entitlement-gated: it
serves on the default included scenario on premium and non-premium accounts alike, so the proxy
sends nothing special for it.

**The tool agent depends on the account.** With the Copilot Studio tool agent attached, GPT-6 Sol
serves on a premium (paid Copilot) account and returns a canned apology on a non-premium one.
Nothing in the login token tells the two apart, so the proxy tries: the first tool request carries
the agent, and if it comes back as that dead route the proxy remembers it for the rest of the
process and re-sends the request without the agent. Your client never sees the failure; a
non-premium account spends one ~3 s turn per proxy start, which `M365_FORCE_AGENT=0` avoids. A
premium account occasionally returns the same apology as a one-off; once the agent has answered,
the proxy treats that as a transient and retries instead of dropping the agent.

**Without the agent it has a sandbox of its own.** It runs `bash` in a remote machine (`/mnt/data`,
`/home/oai`), finds none of your files there, and asks you to upload them, or hands back a Teams link
to a file it made. Turning off M365's code interpreter (`M365_NO_CODE_INTERPRETER=1`) doesn't stop
it. The `relay` framing does: on the bench it solved 60/60 agent-less, against 0–6/10 for every
other framing, and 30/30 with the agent (the others 3–9/10). Through real pi it solved 21/21 runs
across both kinds of account. `relay` is the default on both paths.
Details: [hypotheses §23](docs/hypotheses.md).

### Sonnet 5 (`claude-sonnet-5`) — its own sandbox, and the `relay` framing

`Claude_Sonnet` is Sonnet 4.6 on the included scenario and **Sonnet 5** on the paid one, so
`claude-sonnet-5` needs a paid/premium seat, like Opus. It is not separately metered.

Sonnet 5 arrives with **its own tools** (`bash_tool`, `create_file`, …) running in a remote
sandbox (`/home/claude`) that cannot see your files, and it reads the proxy's usual
`<system>`-tagged tool framing as a prompt injection — so with that framing it inspects its own
empty sandbox and reports that your files don't exist (6/40 on the bench). The proxy therefore
gives both Sonnet models a different default framing, `relay`: a plain note asking it to guide you through your
terminal one command at a time, which also tells it the sandbox is the wrong machine. That
scores **27/30** on the bench (from 5/30) and solved **5/5** fix-bug runs through real pi.
Sonnet 4.6 uses `relay` too (78/90 vs 47/76). Override with `M365_FRAMING_VARIANT` as usual.
Details: hypotheses §21.

### Opus (`claude-opus`) — entitlement + a separate, small quota

The model behind this tone is **Claude Opus 5**. It performs very well here, with two things
to know before you point an agent at it.

**It needs the paid scenario.** M365 gates the model list on the `scenario` sent with the
WebSocket connection. On the default `OfficeWebIncludedCopilot` the Opus tone is accepted but
never reaches a model — it returns a canned apology, which is why earlier notes in this repo
recorded Opus as a dead tone. The proxy now sends `scenario=OfficeWebPaidCopilot` (with the
`licenseType=Premium` that pairs with it) automatically whenever the resolved tone is
`Claude_Opus`; every model except `gpt-6-think-deeper` and `claude-sonnet-5` keeps the included scenario. This is an
**entitlement, not a bypass** — your account has to actually hold paid/premium Copilot access, and `licenseType`
alone unlocks nothing. Override either with `M365_SCENARIO` / `M365_LICENSE_TYPE`.

**It is metered separately, and the proxy spends it fast.** Opus draws on a "priority access"
budget distinct from the ~600-message conversation cap. When it runs out, M365 replies with
text rather than an error — *"You've used your available priority access to the Opus model for
today…"* (or *"…for the week"*). Left alone that reads to an agent as the model's answer, so the
proxy detects both wordings and returns **HTTP 429** (`code: priority_access_exhausted`) with a
`Retry-After`. **Both budgets reset at midnight UTC**; the weekly one on Monday.

Because agentic turns prepend a tool-framing block, driving Opus through a proxy burns that
budget faster than chatting with it by hand. Opus therefore defaults to the lean `minimal`
framing (~82% smaller than the default `baseline`, which exists to force M365's chat-tuned GPT
path to act and which Opus doesn't need). Whether the budget counts tokens or messages is
**not verified** — if it's per-message this saves latency rather than quota. Set
`M365_FRAMING_VARIANT=baseline` to opt out. See [docs/hypotheses.md §15](docs/hypotheses.md).

## Image generation

M365 Copilot generates images through a built-in server-side tool, and the core
package exposes it as one call. The picture comes back on a `GraphicArt` frame as
a URL (never as chat text), and the bytes sit behind a separate auth boundary —
`generateImage()` handles both, returning the image with bytes attached:

```ts
import { generateImage } from "@m365-copilot/core";

const [img] = await generateImage("A minimalist flat-design logo of a lighthouse, teal and white.");
// img.data      -> Buffer (real PNG, verified end-to-end)
// img.base64    -> same bytes, ready for an OpenAI-style b64_json response
// img.contentType, img.size, img.orientation
```

Everything the M365 web client can do is reachable — the proxy sends the same image
optionsSets it does. Steer type and aspect with options (they nudge the prompt the
way the GUI's meta-prompting does; the model still makes the final call):

```ts
await generateImage("a lighthouse on a cliff", { orientation: "portrait" });   // landscape | portrait | square
await generateImage("a lighthouse", { style: "icon" });                        // natural | icon | story | designer
```

**You don't have to call `generateImage` at all.** Just like the web client, a plain
chat turn draws when asked — send `"draw me an image of a green teapot"` to
`/v1/chat/completions` (or `ModelSession.run`) with no tools and the image comes back
embedded in the reply as a markdown data-URI. (Image gen is enabled on the agent-less
path only, so it never competes with tool calling; set `M365_NO_IMAGE_GEN=1` to force
pure text.)

Runs its own agent-less session. Uses the same login as chat; the artifact fetch uses
a `designerappservice` token acquired silently from the existing cache. Protocol
write-up: [docs/hypotheses.md §14](docs/hypotheses.md).

An OpenAI-compatible `POST /v1/images/generations` endpoint on top of this is the
next step — the core API it needs is already in place.

## Authentication

The auth flow uses Azure MSAL with PKCE:

1. **Silent refresh** — cached tokens from `~/.config/opencode-m365/msal-cache.json`. The
   normal path; costs nothing and opens nothing.
2. **Automated login** — headless Playwright browser driving the AAD form with stored
   credentials + a TOTP code generated from `mfaSecret`.
3. **Interactive approval** — visible browser, human completes SSO/MFA (§13). Only when
   `M365_ENABLE_INTERACTIVE_APPROVAL=1`, and only after step 2 is unavailable or has
   actually failed. This is the path for tenants where no TOTP seed exists.

All three redeem the code against `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient`
with PKCE. That redirect isn't a stylistic choice: the client is Microsoft's own Copilot app
(the Sydney scopes are granted to no other), so nobody can register a loopback URI — a
generated `http://localhost:<port>` callback is rejected with `AADSTS50011`, and the device-code
grant demands a `client_secret` only Microsoft holds (`AADSTS7000218`). Both measured live in
[§13](docs/hypotheses.md); don't spend probes re-deriving them.

Three token scopes are acquired:
- `substrate.office.com/sydney/*` — For M365 Copilot chat
- `api.powerplatform.com/.default` — For Copilot Studio agent management
- `api.bap.microsoft.com/.default` — For environment discovery

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `M365_DEBUG` | Set to `1` to enable debug logging to `~/.config/opencode-m365/debug.log` (truncated payloads) |
| `M365_TRACE` | Set to `1` for full, untruncated debug logging (every WS frame/prompt/response) — implies `M365_DEBUG`. For reverse engineering. |
| `M365_LOG_STDOUT` | Set to `1` to mirror debug lines to the proxy's stdout as well as the log file, so you can watch a run without tailing it in a second terminal. Needs `M365_DEBUG` or `M365_TRACE` — on its own it logs nothing. |
| `M365_DUMP_FRAMES` | Set to `1` to write every WebSocket frame (both directions) to `~/.config/opencode-m365/frames/<requestId>.ndjson`. For offline diffing of new M365 fields. |
| `M365_ALLOW_MULTI_TOOL` | Allow the model to emit multiple tool calls per turn (default: only the first is kept) |
| `M365_INJECT_REPLY_TOOL` | Set to `1` to inject a synthetic `reply(text)` tool. Forces every turn to be a tool call, including pure-prose answers. Cleaner contract for the model, +1 tool to the prompt (watch the Disengaged threshold). Confirmed 5/5 compliance on June 9 2026 ([hypotheses §1.1](docs/hypotheses.md)). |
| `M365_NO_CONFAB_RETRY` / `M365_CONFAB_RETRIES` | M365's chat model sometimes produces prose instead of a tool call when it should act — either confabulating an inability ("I can't access the files, please paste them") **or** claiming a completion it never did ("I've replaced the README", with no tool call). By default the proxy detects both and re-prompts forcefully **in the same conversation** (`M365_CONFAB_RETRIES`, default `1`) to force a real action. Set `M365_NO_CONFAB_RETRY=1` to disable. |
| `M365_NO_BACKOFF` (alias `M365_NO_AUTO_REAUTH`) | Set to `1` to disable degradation backoff. By default, when empty/throttled responses span several **distinct conversations** in a short window (the thread-rate-throttle signature, [F13](docs/hypotheses.md)), the proxy **paces subsequent turns** (a jittered delay before starting new backend conversations) to let the account self-heal. This replaced the old auto-reauth: a fresh login does **not** clear this throttle (it's `oid`-keyed — [§11 H-R1](docs/hypotheses.md)) and raised our detection profile. A single long pi thread never trips the trigger. |
| `M365_BACKOFF_THRESHOLD` / `M365_BACKOFF_WINDOW_MS` / `M365_BACKOFF_BASE_MS` / `M365_BACKOFF_MAX_MS` | Tune backoff: distinct-conversation empties to trigger (default `3`), the window they must fall in (default `120000`), the initial pacing window (default `90000`), and its escalation cap (default `600000`). |
| `M365_BROWSER_PROFILE` / `M365_LOGIN_UA` | Override the persistent browser-profile dir and the login User-Agent used for the (rare) automated interactive login. The persistent profile keeps AAD SSO/device cookies so repeat logins are silent and look like a familiar device ([§11 H-R3](docs/hypotheses.md)). |
| `M365_ENABLE_INTERACTIVE_APPROVAL` | Set to `1` to allow a **visible** browser window for sign-in when the automated login can't work or fails — the fallback for tenants with no TOTP option (push-only MFA, FIDO2, Okta/Ping/Duo). You complete SSO/MFA by hand once; tokens refresh silently afterwards. Off by default so headless hosts fail loudly rather than hang. See [If your tenant has no TOTP option](#if-your-tenant-has-no-totp-option). |
| `M365_NO_INTERACTIVE` | Set to `1` to hard-disable any visible browser login, overriding the flag above. For systemd/CI hosts where a window must never open. |
| `M365_INTERACTIVE_TIMEOUT_MS` | How long to wait for you to finish the interactive sign-in (default `600000`, i.e. 10 minutes). |
| `M365_LOGIN_LOCALE` / `M365_LOGIN_TIMEZONE` | Browser locale and timezone presented during login (defaults `en-GB` / `Europe/Copenhagen`). These are part of the anti-bot-scoring fingerprint ([§11 F25](docs/hypotheses.md)) — set them to match your own machine if AAD starts treating your automated login as a bot. |
| `M365_FORCE_AGENT` | Override which tool requests carry the Copilot Studio tool agent. `1` attaches it to every tool request (and turns off the `gpt-6-sol` fallback below); `0` never attaches it. Unset, the proxy decides per model: GPT-5.x and `m365-copilot` take it, Claude and `gpt-6-think-deeper` don't, and `gpt-6-sol` takes it only on a premium account, which the proxy learns from the first request. On a non-premium account `0` saves that one ~3 s probe turn per proxy start. |
| `M365_SCENARIO` / `M365_LICENSE_TYPE` | Override the entitlement the WebSocket is opened under (defaults: `OfficeWebIncludedCopilot` / `Starter`, switching to `OfficeWebPaidCopilot` / `Premium` for the entitlement-gated models — `claude-opus`, `gpt-6-think-deeper` and `claude-sonnet-5`). `scenario` is what gates the model list (and picks Sonnet 4.6 vs 5 for the `Claude_Sonnet` tone); `licenseType` rides along and unlocks nothing by itself. |
| `M365_CACHE_FILE` | Override MSAL token cache location |
| `M365_SECRETS_FILE` | Override credentials file location |
| `CHROMIUM_PATH` | Path to Chromium binary for automated login |

### Usage / context-window % in responses

The OpenAI `usage` block in every chat completion response now includes M365
extension fields with the **per-conversation message quota** — the closest
proxy we have to "context-window utilisation" since M365 hides token counts:

```json
"usage": {
  "prompt_tokens": 0,
  "completion_tokens": 0,
  "total_tokens": 0,
  "x_m365_conversation_messages": 42,
  "x_m365_conversation_max": 600,
  "x_m365_conversation_pct": 7,
  "x_m365_conversation_remaining": 558,
  "x_m365_content_origin": "DeepLeo",
  "x_m365_message_type": null,
  "x_m365_turn_count": 3,
  "x_m365_classifier_scores": {
    "BotOffense": 1.27e-7,
    "dea_violation": 2.81e-6
  },
  "x_m365_dea_score": 2.81e-6,
  "x_m365_offense_score": 1.27e-7
}
```

`x_m365_dea_score` is M365's own "disengaged-eligible answer" classifier
score — the closest signal to "am I about to get Disengaged?". Empirically:
clean tool calls sit at ~1 × 10⁻⁸, prose at ~1 × 10⁻⁶, jailbreak-shaped
prompts at ~1 × 10⁻³. Disengaged itself fires at some threshold > 2 × 10⁻³
that we haven't yet pinpointed. Clients can monitor this to back off before
tripping the filter.

Clients that ignore unknown extension fields keep working; curious users can
read them. See [docs/hypotheses.md §0](docs/hypotheses.md) for the full
findings dump and [§2](docs/hypotheses.md) for what we tried and didn't find.

## Config files

All stored in `~/.config/opencode-m365/`:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `secrets.json` | Login credentials (email, password, mfaSecret) |
| `msal-cache.json` | MSAL token cache (auto-managed) |
| `agent-id.json` | Cached Copilot Studio agent ID |

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build            # Build all packages
pnpm run dev          # Start standalone proxy on :4141
pnpm run test:unit    # Run vitest unit tests (no auth/network)
pnpm run test:live    # Run live integration tests against M365
```

## Known limitations

- **M365 "disengages" on large tool payloads** — heavy agent harnesses (e.g. opencode's ~15-tool prompt) get empty `Disengaged` responses. Keep the toolset lean (this is why [pi](https://pi.dev/) works well). A heavy harness can be trimmed to fit, though opencode in particular needs that done in the proxy rather than through its own config, and its tool count has since dropped — see [docs/m365-copilot-api.md](docs/m365-copilot-api.md#the-disengaged-filter).
- Tool calling is emulated (prompt injection + a Copilot Studio agent), not native function calling — robust with the agent, unreliable without it
- The `think-deeper` / `*_Reasoning` models take 10-30s per response
- Hard quota of ~600 messages **per conversation** (mitigated by session reuse + delta sends)
- `claude-opus` needs a paid/premium seat and has its own small priority-access quota that resets at midnight UTC (weekly on Monday); exhaustion surfaces as a 429, not as a model answer
- Streaming: **tool-less** responses stream incrementally (deltas forwarded as they arrive). **Tool-calling** turns are still buffered server-side — the raw text has to be parsed for tool-call fences before it can be emitted — so those arrive as a single chunk at the end (with an immediate HTTP 200 + heartbeats so the client never times out waiting)
